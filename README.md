# CodeComplex-Data
The dataset is maintained by a set of field values that contain each variable.
Currently, there are two datasets for each of the languages: Python and Java.

```src```: The raw source code of the program.

```complexity```: The time complexity of the program, can be one of the following seven classes ('constant', 'logn', 'linear', 'nlogn', 'quadratic', 'cubic', 'exponential')

```problem```: The problem number of the program. It contains the contest round number and the problem ID. The format is in "round number"_"problem ID".

```from```: The origin of the program. In the case of this dataset, all source codes are from CODEFORCES.

```tags```: The tags for the specific problem. There can be multiple tag types for each problem. (e.g. dp, trees, implementation)
